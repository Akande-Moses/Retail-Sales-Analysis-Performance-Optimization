# Retail Sales Analysis & Performance Optimization

In this project, I conducted a detailed analysis of retail sales performance across multiple branches, with the goal of uncovering trends in product sales, customer behavior, staff contributions, and branch profitability. My main objective was to address inconsistencies in sales performance and provide actionable insights that could help improve operational efficiency and profitability.

Using Power BI, I designed and developed interactive dashboards that allowed me to explore sales data over a two-year period (2023-2024). Through these dashboards, I was able to drill down into branch-level revenue patterns, evaluate staff productivity, and segment customer behavior to uncover areas of opportunity.


**Key Insights**

1. Sales Performance: Over the two years, total revenue amounted to $5.12 million, with $2.61 million generated in 2023 and $2.51 million in 2024, a -3.93% year-over-year decline.
Dettol Antiseptic was the best-performing product, generating $3.08 million, while Indomie Instant Noodles underperformed with only $269,750 in sales.
2. Branch Performance: Of the five branches (Abuja, Ibadan, Lagos, Kano, and Port Harcourt), Port Harcourt achieved the highest total revenue of $1.11 million, while Kano recorded the lowest at $974,400.
However, Kano showed the highest growth rate with a 31.84% year-over-year revenue increase, whereas Ibadan suffered the steepest decline at -19.63%, despite ranking second in total revenue.
3. Staff Performance: Sales Representatives were the main revenue drivers, contributing $1.94 million, while Store Managers generated the least at $625,872.
My analysis also revealed no correlation between years of service and sales performance, meaning experience alone did not guarantee higher productivity.
4. Customer Behavior: Gold members were the most engaged and generated the highest sales, while Regular members contributed the least.
The 53-60 age group made the most purchases, whereas the 18-24 age group had the lowest purchase rate.
 

**Recommendations**

1. Double Down on High-Value Customer Segments: Focus marketing and loyalty initiatives on Gold members and the 53-60 age group, offering tailored promotions, exclusive deals, and retention programs.
2. Optimize the Product Portfolio: Prioritize stocking and promoting high-performing products like Dettol Antiseptic, while reviewing marketing, pricing, and positioning strategies for underperforming items such as Indomie Instant Noodles.
3. Address Underperforming Branches: Conduct a deeper operational review of branches like Ibadan to uncover reasons for declining sales (e.g., local competition, customer service, stock management) and implement corrective measures.
4. Support High-Growth Branches: Leverage Kanoâ€™s growth momentum by increasing resource allocation, more staff, targeted marketing, and inventory expansion.
5. Rethink Staff Performance Management: Implement skills-based training programs, introduce performance-based incentives, and use data-driven tracking to improve staff contribution, rather than relying on tenure.
6. Capture the Younger Demographic: Develop youth-focused campaigns and modern product bundles to engage the 18-24 age group, using social media promotions, student discounts, and trend-driven product lines.
